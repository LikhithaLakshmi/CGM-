🏠 CGM 3D House
A 3D house simulation using OpenGL and C++.

📌 Overview
This project is a Computer Graphics & Multimedia (CGM) assignment that demonstrates a 3D house model using OpenGL in C++. It includes essential graphical transformations, lighting, and textures to create a realistic rendering.


🎯 Features
✅ 3D house structure (walls, roof, doors, and windows)
✅ Camera controls (rotation, zoom, and movement)
✅ Lighting effects (ambient, diffuse, and specular)
✅ Textured surfaces for realism
✅ Keyboard and mouse interaction

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++

Graphics Library: OpenGL (FreeGLUT/GLFW)

Development Environment: Code::Blocks / Visual Studio
